## Project Overview

Executed a comprehensive multi-stage paid social campaign for a wellness brand over a two-week period (October 12-25, 2024). The campaign strategically targeted audiences across three distinct funnels - awareness, traffic, and conversion - leveraging seasonal content to maximize engagement and drive measurable results ahead of Black Friday.

## The Challenge

The wellness brand needed to:
- Build brand awareness among both cold and warm audiences
- Drive meaningful traffic to their Instagram profile and blog
- Convert seasonal interest into actual purchases
- Maximize impact with a limited budget across multiple objectives

## Campaign Structure & Performance

The campaign was structured across three strategic funnels, each optimized for specific objectives:

| Conversion | £556 | 59.9K | 1,077 site visits | £0.16 |

## Key Insights

3. **Budget Reallocation**: Moved spend to high-performing content and audiences
4. **Seasonal Alignment**: Adjusted messaging to match autumn/winter themes
